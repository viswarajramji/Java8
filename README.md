* The lambda variable name and the local variable names cannot be same.
* The local variables cannot be modified inside lambda expressions.
* No restrictions for instance variables.
* A local variable used inside a lambda expression is termed as effectively final. [Refer](https://github.com/viswarajramji/Java8/blob/master/src/lambda/LambdaLocalVariables.java) 
* In General until Java 7, Any variables used inside anonymous function must be declared as final.
